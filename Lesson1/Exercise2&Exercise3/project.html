        <h5>May 2021 - June 2021</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Used Raspberry Pi to build a building management system that
            controls and monitors the building’s ventilation, lighting, power
            system, and security systems
          </li>
          <li>
            Obtained local humidity from CIMIS API and local temperature from
            DHT-11 sensor to control room temperature with passive infrared
            sensors for ambient light control
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitored perimeter’s entrances to control room temperature and
            display all the information on LCD
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Worked in a team to document and design an IOS mobile app that
            displays weather forecasts based on the location from OpenWeather
            API using Swift
          </li>
          <li>
            Setup a server on Back4App; configure the IOS app to communicate

        <ul>
          <li>
            Worked in a team to document and create a chess program in C that
            allows a user to play interactive chess against the computer with
            the support of multiplayer functionality and chat functionality
            using socket communication
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed algorithms to move each piece, determine the check
            condition, and check the legality of castling; implemented a
            graphical user interface using GTK+ 2.0

            operations to the image, and save the processed image in a file
          </li>
          <li>
            Utilized dynamic memory allocation and data structure to resize the
            images and apply the filters by changing each pixel
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed an algorithm using linked lists to make a movie from the
            manipulated images
