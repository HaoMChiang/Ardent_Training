        Hello! I am Hao-Ming Chiang, a student at UCI pursuing a B.S. in
        Computer Engineering. As an enthusiastic student, learner, developer,
        and engineer, I can utilize my software development skills with my
        logical, effective, and creative thinking to solve real-world problems.
        From the projects I have worked on as a Computer Engineering student, I
        can work in a team-driven environment, offering my tenacity and
        enthusiasm for developing software.
